# ViewportSize #

ViewportSize is a simple and easy-to-use AngularJS service which gives access to the viewport's height and width.

## Get Started ##

1. Install via bower by running  `$ bower install angular-viewport-size` from your terminal.
1. Add `'common.viewport-size'` to your module's list of dependencies.

## Usage ##

Simply call `viewportSize.height` or `viewportSize.width` and you'll get back the expected result as a number. 

These two properties, **height** and **width**, are defined as [getters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) for simplicity sake.
